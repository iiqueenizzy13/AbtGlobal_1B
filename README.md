## Project Description, Team's Objectives, and Goals
Leveraging AI methodologies to understand correlations between weather conditions, in particular temperature fluctuations, and the rate of positive COVID-19 tests. This project involves working with public time series data, including COVID data from 2020â€“2021 and the corresponding weather data.

### Team's Objective 
- Predict the rate of positive COVID-19 tests using data on weather conditions.
- Use a sliding window method to handle the time series data.
- Evaluate predictive results for overfitting.

### Desired Outcomes
Present the results of our analysis of relationships between weather conditions and COVID-19 rates.  
This project hopes to provide critical insights that can inform public health strategies, improve resource allocation, community preparedness and resilience, and support policy/decision-making.
