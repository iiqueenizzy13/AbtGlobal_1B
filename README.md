## Project Description
    Leveraging AI methodologies to understand correlations between weather conditions, in particular temperature fluctuations, and the rate of positive COVID-19 tests. This project will involve working with public time series data, including COVID data from 2020-2021 and the corresponding weather data. 

## Team's Objective
    - Predict the rate of positive COVID-19 tests using data on weather conditions
    - Use a sldng window method to handle the tme series data
    - Evaluate predictive results for overfitting

## Desired Outcomes
    Present the results of our analysis of relationships between weather conditions and COVID-19 rates
    This projet hopes to provide critical insights that can inform public healthn strategies, improve resource allocation, community preparedness and resilience, and policy/decision-making support.
